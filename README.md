# CodeChallenges
This is an aggregation of well-known coding challenges and programs in order to demonstrate my proficiency in multiple languages and tasks.
Most tasks come from rosettacode.org, but other sources may be used.
No cheating (looking at implementations) was involved, as that defeats the purpose of doing this for both me and you.
